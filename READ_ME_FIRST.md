## 💬 What to Tell Your Friend

**When you give them the ZIP, say:**

> "Here's the complete project with documentation. Start by opening `TRANSFER_PACKAGE_README.md` - it explains everything and guides you to the other docs. Follow `STEP_BY_STEP_CHECKLIST.md` day by day. You'll create your own Firebase and Vercel accounts, so everything will be under your name. The guides cover everything from installing Node.js to presenting confidently. Should take about 7 days total. Good luck! 🚀"
